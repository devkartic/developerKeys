# Docker Engine overview


Docker Engine is an open source containerization technology for building and containerizing your applications. Docker Engine acts as a client-server application with:

A server with a long-running daemon process dockerd.
APIs which specify interfaces that programs can use to talk to and instruct the Docker daemon.
A command line interface (CLI) client docker.
The CLI uses Docker APIs to control or interact with the Docker daemon through scripting or direct CLI commands. Many other Docker applications use the underlying API and CLI. The daemon creates and manage Docker objects, such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.

Docker Engine has three types of update channels, stable, test, and nightly:

Stable gives you latest releases for general availability.
Test gives pre-releases that are ready for testing before general availability.
Nightly gives you latest builds of work in progress for the next major release.
