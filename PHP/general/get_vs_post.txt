### What is the difference between PHP's get method & post method ?

The GET method :

    a. It sends encoded user information append to the page request.

    b. The GET method produces a long string that appears in your server logs, in the browser's Location: box.

    c. The GET method is restricted to send upto 2048 characters only.

    d. Never use GET method if you have password or other sensitive information to be sent to the server.

    e. GET can't be used to send binary data, like images or word documents, to the server.

    f. The data sent by GET method can be accessed using QUERY_STRING environment variable.

    g. The PHP provides $_GET associative array to access all the sent information using GET method.

The POST Method :

    a. The POST method transfers information via HTTP headers. The information is encoded as described in
       case of GET method and put into a header called QUERY_STRING.

    b. The POST method does not have any restriction on data size to be sent.

    c. The POST method can be used to send ASCII as well as binary data.

    d. The data sent by POST method goes through HTTP header so security depends on HTTP protocol.
       By using Secure HTTP you can make sure that your information is secure.

    e. The PHP provides $_POST associative array to access all the sent information using POST method.


    When we use GET in webpages, so itâ€™s mean that we are going to append that data in the designated URL
    And you should know that the POST is not the part of the URL. And the good advantage of using GET is to
    bookmark any URL. As many search engines are using it. As we know the GET is a part of URL so it will
    remain in the browser history. And the POST data will not remain in the browser history. There is also
    another advantage of using POST method that is we can use multipart/form-data for encoding of binary
    data. We can see many examples of GET in our daily life when we are surfing internet. For example Yahoo
    Search - Web Search there are many examples like this in which we can get data easily. There is another
    method in PHP programming which we can use it instead of POST and GET that is REQUEST.
