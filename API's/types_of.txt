# Different types of api

1. SOAP
2. XML-RPC
3. JSON-RPC
4. REST

The following are the most common types of web service APIs:

1. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):

    This is a protocol that uses XML as a format to transfer data. Its main function is to define
    the structure of the messages and methods of communication. It also uses WSDL, 
    or Web Services Definition Language, in a machine-readable document to publish a definition 
    of its interface.

2. XML-RPC: 

    This is a protocol that uses a specific XML format to transfer data compared to SOAP that 
    uses a proprietary XML format. It is also older than SOAP. XML-RPC uses minimum bandwidth
    and is much simpler than SOAP. 
    
    Example:-
    <employees>
    <employee>
        <firstName>Becky</firstName> <lastName>Smith</lastName>


3. JSON-RPC: 

    This protocol is similar to XML-RPC but instead of using XML format to transfer data ituses JSON. 
    
    Example :-
    {"employees":[
    { "firstName":"Becky", "lastName":"Smith" },

4. REST (Representational State Transfer): 

    REST is not a protocol like the other web services, instead, it is a set of architectural
    principles. The REST service needs to have certain characteristics, including simple 
    interfaces, which are resources identified easily within the request and manipulation of 
    resources using the interface.
