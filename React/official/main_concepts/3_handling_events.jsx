/*
You have to be careful about the meaning of this in JSX callbacks. In JavaScript,
class methods are not bound by default. If you forget to bind this.handleClick and pass
it to onClick, this will be undefined when the function is actually called.

This is not React-specific behavior; it is a part of how functions work in JavaScript. Generally,
if you refer to a method without () after it, such as onClick={this.handleClick}, you should bind that method.

If calling bind annoys you, there are two ways you can get around this. If you are using the experimental
public class fields syntax, you can use class fields to correctly bind callbacks
