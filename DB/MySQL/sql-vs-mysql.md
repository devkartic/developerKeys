##  SQL vs MySQL: What's the Difference?

### 1. What is SQL?

    SQL is a language which is used to operate your database. SQL is the basic language used for all the
    databases. There are minor syntax changes amongst different databases, but the basic SQL syntax
    remains largely the same. SQL is a short abbreviation of Structured Query Language. According to
    ANSI (American National Standards Institute), SQL is the standard language to operate a relational
    database management system.

    SQL is used in the accessing, updating, and manipulation of data in a database. Its design allows for
    the management of data in an RDBMS, such as MYSQL. SQL language also used for controlling data access
    and for creation and modification of Database schemas.


### 2. What is MYSQL?

    Developed in the mid-90s., MySQL was one of the first open-source database available in the market.
    Today there are many alternatives variants of MySQL,. However, the differences between the variants
    are not significant as they use the same syntax, and basic functionality also remains same.

    MySQL is an RDBMS that allows keeping the data that exists in a database organized. MySQL is
    pronounced as "My S-Q-L," but it is also called "My Sequel." It is named after co-founder Michael
    Widenius' daughter. MySQL provides a multi-user access to databases. This RDBMS system is used with
    the combination of PHP and Apache Web Server, on top of a Linux distribution. MySQL uses the
    SQL language to query the database.
