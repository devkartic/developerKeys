## Difference between a distinct and group by

### Introduction

    DISTINCT is used to filter unique records out of the records that satisfy the query criteria. The "GROUP BY" clause is used when you need to group the data and it should be used to apply aggregate operators to each group. Sometimes, people get confused when to use DISTINCT and when and why to use GROUP BY in SQL queries.
    
    Letâ€™s understand how and when to use DISTINCT and GROUP BY.

### DISTINCT :

    When you have a result set containing more than one duplicate records, then you can get unique results out of that by using DISTINCT.

    
### GROUP BY :

    GROUP BY is used when you want to group your data with some criteria or any aggregate function on grouped data.
